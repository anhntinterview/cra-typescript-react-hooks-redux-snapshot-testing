Tip: pour the wine into the tomato paste jar and shake it to get the last of the paste out.\n\nAdd canned tomatoes, cumin, caraway seeds, bay leaves, paprika, erythritol, concentrated stock, and pepper. Yes, that is a lot of cumin; it will be fine. Bring to low boil, reduce heat, simmer for 20 min\n\nPlace de-stemmed Swiss chard leaves on top of cooked tomato mixture. Make 8 small depressions with a spoon\n\nCrack one egg into each depression. Cover (a transparent lid is ideal)\n\nCook until egg white is _just_ set. Serve immediately, in the pan.\n\n- The tomato sauce keeps for a couple of days in the fridge. If eating over two days, crack only 4 eggs. Next time, reheat sauce then make 4 more depressions and crack the other 4.\n- We use Sukrin Gold erythritol, which looks and tastes like light brown sugar. If not low-carbing, demarara or other sugar can be substituted.\n- Bell peppers are bad for absorbing pesticides, so we always use organic because the skin is eaten.\n- The type of red wine is not critical, honestly. We use small (187ml) “individual” bottles of fairly cheap red wine.",

Repeat until it's soft, usually doesn’t need more than 2 minutes total.\n\nAdd the eggs and mix gently.\n\nPut a piece of parchment paper over your pizza stone, add the dough on top of it and then another piece of parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll it as close as possible to the pizza stone shape and evenly around 5mm thick or less. Remove the top sheet of parchment paper.\n\nMake fork holes all over the pizza base to ensure it cooks evenly.\n\nBake at 215C/420F for 15 minutes or until golden brown.\n\nIf you can manage to flip the pizza over without breaking it, flip it and bake a bit longer to make it crispy. If you’re worried it will break don't flip it, we never do and it’s fine!\n\nWhile the base is baking, make the tomato sauce: in a mini-blender of food processor blend the tomato paste, garlic wine, basil, Worcestershire sauce, oregano. Cook at medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes or until thickened a bit.\n\nWhile the base is baking and the sauce simmering, cut the bacon into 5mm lardons and sauté with the mushrooms until almost (but not completely) cooked to your liking.\n\nOnce the pizza base is done, spread the sauce over it as evenly as you can (a brush or rubber spatula helps). Then add the remaining grated cheeses, the bacon, the mushrooms, the pepper, the pineapple.\n\nBroil at 260C/500F for about 5 minutes, checking frequently because ovens vary. Enjoy!",

Can’t find graviera? Use any yellow cheese that melts. The sfouggato in this photo was actually made with cheddar!\n- Don’t have all the ingredients? Worry not! This is a dish with many variations. Most of the ingredients are optional. What is absolutely mandatory is the eggs, zucchinis, some herbs (parsley, dill, and/or mint), some kind of cheese, and some kind of onion (only red onion or only spring onion is ok).",

    "description": "A delicious low carb treat!\n\n**Base:** \n1. In a medium frying pan, melt the ghee under low heat. \n2. Add the almond and coconut flour and stir continuously. \n3. It will look very runny at first, that's normal. When it starts darkening and becoming more viscous, add the cinnamon and sweetener. \n4. When it's light brown and most of the the ghee has been absorbed, it's about done. At that point, add the vanilla extract. It will foam, that's ok. Stir until it goes down again.\n5. Press into a 9\" springform cake tray. Let it cool down in the fridge.\n\n**Cream**: With a mixer beat the mascarpone on its own for a bit, then add icing sugar substitute to taste, then the rest of the ingredients. Blend until even. If you want the cheesecake to be extra fluffy, just beat it longer. Make sure the ghee in the bottom layer has solidified, then spread over the base in the cake tray. Put it back in the fridge.\n\n**Topping**: Blend half of the fruits and cut the other half into slices. Using a small pot, heat up the blended strawberries, Sukrin Gold, lemon juice and stir frequently until all heated up and mixed well. Add the gelatin slowly by sprinkling and stirring so that it doesn't clump. Then add the sliced fruits and stir. Simmer for a bit, then take it off the heat and let it cool down a bit. Once it starts getting viscous, spread it over the cream and put it back in the fridge.\n\nChill in the fridge for at least 3 hours, then enjoy!\n\n- We use Sukrin Gold and Sukrin Icing for sweetening. We've tried many and think those are as close as it gets to the sugar equivalents and have no aftertaste.\n- You can use less mascarpone, the middle layer will just be less thick. Adjust the rest of the quantities accordingly in that case.",
